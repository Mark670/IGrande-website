# IGrande-website
The website provides user to book rooms and admin to manipulate through records at the Imperial Grande.
The project was about providing online room booking services to the customers. The website mainly included photos, reviews, invoice including cost of rooms. We used HTML, CSS for designing front-end of website and managed the customer data with invoicing including MySQL. Mainly used PHP MyAdmin to handle the administration of MySQL server & perform admin tasks by creating various DBs, running queries, triggers for invoices & adding users.
